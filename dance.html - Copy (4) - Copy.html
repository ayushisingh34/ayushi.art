<h2>1. BALLET </h2>



</body>
</html> 

       
        <br>
        <br>

        <p3>Ballet dance developed during the Italian Renaissance, before evolving in France and Russia into a concert dance meant for public performance. This is in the form of a ballet, in which the dance is choreographed with classical music.

            Ballet productions vary between using elaborate costumes and staging and using minimal costuming and bare staging.
            
            Ballet is now a widespread, highly technical form of dance with many subgenres including classic, romantic, neoclassical and contemporary.
            
            With six core recognised methods: the Cecchetti method, the Bournoville method, the Vaganova method, the French School, the Royal Academy of Dance method and the Balanchine method, ballet is studied professionally at top dance schools all over the world.
            
            Harlequin Floors have developed a range of specialist ballet dance floors providing enough traction to prevent injury while still allowing for fluid movements demanded by ballet dancing. Harlequin Cascade is one of our most popular ballet dance floors and can be laid over many of our sprung floors. 
            
            Harlequin Floors also offer professional ballet barres available as either permanent wall mounted, floor mounted or freestanding barres.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p6>Developed during the mid-twentieth century, contemporary dance is now one of the most popular and technical forms of dance studied and performed professionally, especially in the US and Europe.

                Drawing on classical, modern and jazz dance styles, contemporary dance has evolved to incorporate many characteristics of a broader range of dance forms.
                
                Known for its emphasis on strong torso and legwork, contract and release, fall and recovery and floor work, it is often known for unpredictable and disordered changes in speed and rhythm throughout a performance.
                
                Contemporary dancers therefore require a shock-absorbing surface to protect their feet, legs and ankles from rapid movements and changes in rhythm. Harlequin’s innovative ‘triple sandwich’ Harlequin Activity sprung floor can be paired with several of our vinyl dance floors, to create the ideal surface for contemporary dance.

<h2> 3. HIPHOP </h2>



</body>
</html>


            
            <br>
            <br>
            <p10>Hip-hop dancing refers to a range of street dances that developed in relation to hip hop music and culture. Hip-hop dancing dates back to the early 1970s in New York and California, evolving out of Funk and the development of break beat.

                Main styles of hip-hop dancing include Breaking, Locking and Popping, with derivative styles emerging out of these including Memphis Jookin’, Turfing, Jerkin’ and Krumping. These were often popularised and made mainstream after being featured in music videos of the time.
                
                Today, hip-hop is performed in outdoor spaces, in dance studios and competitively.
                
                Unlike many competitive dance styles, hip-hop is often improvisational with dance crews challenging each other to dance battles.
                
                At Harlequin Floors we have created Harlequin Freestyle, a specialist dance floor designed specifically to meet the unique demands of Hip Hop and other street dance styles.

            <p14>
                Jazz dancing has its roots in seventeenth-century African traditions, brought to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade as slaves continued dancing traditions in Brazil, the US and elsewhere on the continents.

                      Known for its improvisational and dramatic body movements, the jazz dancing grew in popularity in early twentieth-century jazz clubs.

                          Today, jazz dancing builds on African American vernacular dance styles that emerged along with Jazz music in the US. Swing, the Lindy Hop, the Shimmy and the Charleston are popular kinds of jazz dances.

                      For your Jazz dancers, our range of vinyl floors including Harlequin Studio and Harlequin Allegro offer ideal surfaces for practice and performance.

                       <p2> Bharatanatyam is a dance of Tamil Nadu in southern India. It traces its origins back to the Natyashastra, an ancient treatise on theatre written by the mythic priest Bharata. Originally a temple dance for women, bharatanatyam often is used to express Hindu religious stories and devotions. It was not commonly seen on the public stage until the 20th century. The dance movements are characterized by bent legs, while feet keep rhythm. Hands may be used in a series of mudras, or symbolic hand gestures, to tell a story.</p2>

                   <p23>Kathakali comes from southwestern India, around the state of Kerala. Like bharatanatyam, kathakali is a religious dance. It draws inspiration from the Ramayana and stories from Shaiva traditions. Kathakali is traditionally performed by boys and men, even for female roles. The costumes and makeup are especially elaborate, with faces made to look like painted masks and enormous headdresses.</p23>

                    <p1123>
                      A dance of northern India, Kathak is often a dance of love. It is performed by both men and women. The movements include intricate footwork accented by bells worn around the ankles and stylized gestures adapted from normal body language. It was originated by Kathakas, professional storytellers who used a mixture of dance, song, and drama. Like other Indian dances it began as a temple dance, but soon moved into the courts of ruling houses.

Unlike some of the other, more rhythmic dances, Manipuri is characterized by smooth and graceful movements. Female roles are especially fluid in the arms and hands, while male roles tend to have more forceful movements. The dance may be accompanied by narrative chanting and choral singing.</p789>

This dance, from the state of Andhra Pradesh in southeastern India, is highly ritualized, with a formalized song-and-dance introduction, sprinkling of holy water, and burning of incense, along with invocations of goddesses. Traditionally the dance was performed by men, even the female roles, although now it is predominantly performed by women.
